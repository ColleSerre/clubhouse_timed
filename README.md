## For contributor:

* You will need our firebase documents which are closed source but you are welcome to get your own (if you are part of our team just DM me)
* Please leave trailing commas, I am a formatting freak and I **will personally** break your kneecaps if you don't format your code decently
* Please break up views in different files and widgets in different classes
* Exercise proper routing. Flutter offers the very simple *Navigator* API so please use it to its full extent, name your routes with simple and logical ways.
* Bear performance in mind, we don't need a laggy app
